## Tools
* Visual Studio Code

## Skills
Skill I will be using in these projects:
- *Python*
- *Djnago*
- *HTML*
- *Javascript*
- *Bootstrap*
- *MySQL/SQLite*


## Pre-requisites/Installation
We need to install a few software in our system before we can work with Django. I have used a mac terminal for installing these tools.

- **Python**: In order to check if python is installed on your system, enter the below code in the terminal(for mac user) or command prompt (for windows users). It will give you the latest version of the python your system has or will throw an error.

    `python --version`

    - If you dont have Python then you can install the same from [here]("https://www.python.org/downloads/" "")

- **Virtual Enviornment**: We always try to use a virtual environment in order to use Django as Django is dependent on python version. This will isolate our Python/Django setup on a per-project basis. This means that any changes you make to one website won't affect any others you're also developing. The below code will create a virtual environment by the name 'myenv'.

    `pip install virtualenv myvenv`

- **Upgrading Pip**: It is also recommended to upgrade pip fo the virtual environment we have created.
    
    `pip install -upgrade pip`

- **Django** - Now we are ready to install Django in our virtual environment. Buts just before the installation of virtual environment, we need to activate it. 

    `source myvenv/bin/activate`

    Now we will install Django:

    `pip3 install django`

- **MySQL**: MySQL is an optional one as it is used for the database. Django comes with a default SQLite database to work with. If there is a need to use MySQL instead of a database, then we can install it using the below code:

    `pip3 install mysqlclient`

Electrical and Instrumentation Engineer as per degree and Software Engineer by Profession. I am a self-taught coder who has worked on languages like, HTML, Javascript, PHP, Asp.net, and Python. After working for years in a couple of IT companies (One of which was India's best IT Company - WIPRO), I took a break off for the IT World for 4 years to take care of Family Business. During these 4 years, I built an ERP with Billing Software for my own company from scratch on the asp.net platform. Not that I have sold my family business, looking to re-start my IT career as a Python Developer.
