## Synopsis

Depending on the version, users can do everything they could do on amazon book store, like, commenting, sharing the product to friends, maintain a wishlist, ask for a refund and much more.

<!-- Pre-requisites and installation required before working on this project -->
## Pre-requisites/Installation
As mentioned [here]("https://github.com/siddhantshah1986/Django-Projects/blob/master/README.md" ""), we need to install django on our system to work here.

Now we will start a new project using command prompt and start working on the same. Make sure your virtual environment is activated.
    
`djago-admin startproject projectName`

Once our project is created we will start the Django server to visit our website on the local server.

`python projectname/manage.py runserver`

Now if we go to [local host]("https://127.0.0.1:8000" ""), we can see our website.
